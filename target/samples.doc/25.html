<h1>Extended elevation control</h1>
<p>
 Assume following situation (in plan view),
 when there is a loop in centerline between stations 1 and 4, 
 small chimney near station 5
 and entrance to the cave is at station 6.
</p>
<p>
<a href="000019-map1p.pdf"><img border="1" src="000019.png"/></a>
</p>
<p>
 By default, centerline extended elevation of this situation looks like this:
</p>
<p>
<a href="000020-map1x.pdf"><img border="1" src="000020.png"/></a>
</p>
<p>
 This is obviously not what we would like to get.
</p>
<p>
 To control process of extended elevation, there is a special
 <code>extend</code> option in centerline command. 
</p>
<p>
 First of all, we would like to start our extended elevation
 at station 6 (where the entrance is). This can be done by specifying
</p>
<pre class="code">
extend start 6
</pre>
<p>
 in the centerline. Now it looks better,
</p>
<p>
<a href="000021-map2.pdf"><img border="1" src="000021.png"/></a>
</p>
<p>
but there is still a problem with a branch containing station 5.
</p>
<p>
 If we would like to start this branch from station 4, we need
 to forbid therion to extend station 5 from 1. This can be done
 by specifying
</p>
<pre class="code">
extend ignore 1 5
</pre>
<p>
 This means, that shot from 1 to 5 will be ignored, when extended
 elevation is generated. 
</p>
<p>
 If we would like to extend branch starting
 with station 5 to the left, we need to specify also
</p>
<pre class="code">
extend left 5
</pre>
<p>
 This will extend all stations from station 5 to the left.
</p>
<p>
<a href="000022-map3.pdf"><img border="1" src="000022.png"/></a>
</p>
<p>
 As we have mentioned before, there is a small chimney above station 5.
 In this case, it is much more natural to draw this shot as vertical
 (because it is a chimney). To specify this, use 
</p>
<pre class="code">
  extend vertical 5 5'
</pre>
<p>
<a href="000023-map6.pdf"><img border="1" src="000023.png"/></a>
</p>
<p>
 Or you can completely hide this leg from extended centerline using:
</p>
<pre class="code">
  extend hide 5 5'
</pre>
<p>
<a href="000024-map7.pdf"><img border="1" src="000024.png"/></a>
</p>
<a name="0"></a><h2>Stations in extended elevation scraps</h2>
<p>
 Even if the station 1 is present more then one time in the map, 
 therion automatically
 detects correct position of this station in each scrap and they are
 usually drawn correctly.
</p>
<p>
<a href="000025-map4.pdf"><img border="1" src="000025.png"/></a>
</p>
<p>
 The only thing that is missing is connection line between stations 1
 in these two branches.
 Therion does not automatically generate these lines because their
 shape usually depends on particilar map. 
</p>
<p>
 To draw such a line all you need to do is to create a simple scrap 
 with this line. Here is an example:
</p>
<pre class="code">
scrap sc -proj extended
  point 0 0 station -name 1 -from 5 -visibility off
  point 100 0 station -name 1 -from 2 -visibility off
  line map-connection
      0   5
      0  15
    100  15
    100   5
  endline
endscrap
</pre>
<p>
 As you can see, even there are two stations with same name, they
 are distinguished by <code>-from</code> option, which specifies
 previous station in extended elevation. Using this scrap you receive the
 final map:
